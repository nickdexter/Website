            RetroPie is a free software library that allows you to emulate retro games on any type of raspberry pi, 
            from the incredibly small pi zero, all the way up to the latest pi 4. 
            This makes for a great compact and portable emulation machine.
        </p>
        <h2>Part List</h2>
        <p>
            For this project i used the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Raspberry Pi 3b+</li>
            <li>NESPi Case</li>
            <li>Raspberry Pi Power Supply</li>
            <li>Micro SD card (64gb)</li>
            <li>HDMI Cable</li>
            <li>8BitDo SF30</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Initial Setup</h2>
       <p>
        Firstly I started off this project by flashing the RetroPie image to a freshly formatted 64gb micro sd card. 
        I chose a large size because I wanted to make sure i had enough space to fit all the games i wanted as well 
        as custom themes, videos, images, etc. Next i installed the Pi into the NESPi case, connected the included fans 
        and heat sink, then screwed it all together. From here I plugged in everything to the Pi and connected it to a TV 
        and booted it up successfully. Since I was using a wireless controller i had to temporarily connect a keyboard and 
        navigate to the Bluetooth options to connect it.
        </p>
        <h2>Adding ROMs</h2>
        <p>
            Secondly I used SSH to transfer all my ROMs directly from my PC to the Pi over the network. 
            This method is a lot easier and convenient, skipping the step of switching the SD card from the Pi 
            to my PC over, and over, every time I want to add new games. I made sure to enable SSH on the Pi first in 
            the options and to connect to the same wireless network as my PC. Then used WinSCP to SSH to the Pi and simply 
            dumped all the ROM files I wanted onto the SD card.
        </p>
        <h2>Custom Themes</h2>
        <p>
            Lastly I made sure everything was running correctly in each emulator, tweaked a  few settings and button mappings, 
            then started to look as customizing the UI. There are hundreds of themes to choose from but I ended up settling 
            on the pixel theme. I used the scraper inside of RetroPie to scrape each of the games images.
        </p>
        <p>From here my emulation machine was complete! The first game I jumped into was Pokemon Emerald.</p>
