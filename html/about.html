        <p>
            Hi! I’m Nick, an aspiring programmer from Australia looking to 
            broaden my skill-set in all aspects of programming. 
            I’m currently learning C# in hope to aid in my future ambition as a game developer. 
            I’ve also started to dabble in Linux on the side.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was first introduced to programming through HTML when I wanted to learn how websites were made.
             While I only learnt the basics, this sparked my interest in other programming languages. 
             I later took Computer Science as one of my courses in year 12 learning Java, and I absolutely loved it.
        </p>
        <p>
            My first personal project was setting up an emulation machine using RetroPie on a Raspberry Pi. 
            I got everything working on a Pi Zero W and later upgraded to a 3b+ with a NESPi case. 
            In the future I hope to implement my own code into these types of projects.
        </p>
        <p>I hope you enjoy looking through my site and maybe you’ll even learn something!</p>
